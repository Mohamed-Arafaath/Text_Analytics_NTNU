Project title:
An In-depth Analysis of Public Sentiment: Reddit Discourse on the Israel-Palestine Conflict

Motivation:
The "Reddit Discourse on the Israel-Palestine Conflict" project as part of NLP Internship at  Vespa.ai, Norway employed NLP techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in Reddit discussions on this topic. It aimed to uncover the evolution of public sentiment during the conflict.

1. Introduction:
   - Focused on analyzing public sentiment towards the Israel-Palestine conflict using NLP techniques. Aimed to reveal how sentiment evolved during the conflict.

2. Background:
   - Highlighted the importance of pre-processing in NLP for accurate results. Emphasized the need for data pre-processing in sentiment analysis.

3. Dataset:
   - Investigated a large dataset with mixed data types. Streamlined the dataset by removing irrelevant columns.

4. Experimental Setup:
   - Described experiment characteristics and parameters, distinguishing between "self_text" and "post_text" in the dataset.

5. Pre-processing:
   - Conducted text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization. Minimal pre-processing was required for sentiment analysis using VADER and ROBERTA.

6. Models and Algorithms:
   - Utilized various algorithms and models like VADER, LSTM, ROBERTA, and LDA. ROBERTA notably improved sentiment analysis accuracy.

7. Experimental Results:
   - Observed a decrease in neutral posts over time, particularly in user comments, indicating evolving sentiments during the conflict.

Conclusion:
The project underscored the significance of meticulous dataset understanding, adept pre-processing techniques, and the selection of appropriate models for sentiment analysis. Through a comprehensive approach encompassing dataset exploration, pre-processing, model implementation, and temporal sentiment analysis, the project provided valuable insights into public sentiment regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. This endeavor illuminated the evolving dynamics of public opinion over time, underscoring the nuanced nature of societal perspectives within online discourse.
